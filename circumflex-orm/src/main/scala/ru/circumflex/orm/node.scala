/*!# Relation Nodes

The `RelationNode` is essentially a wrapper around relation which provides
an `alias` so that it can participate in complex SQL query plans.

Generally a relation node is created implicitly from `Relation`.
A special alias `this` is assigned to new relation nodes, it is transformed
inside queries into a query-unique alias so that no collisions occur.

You may assign an alias explicitly using the `AS` method.

  /*!## Equality & Others

  Two nodes are considered equal if they wrap the same relation and share
  same aliases.

  The `hashCode` method delegates to node's relation.

  The `canEqual` method indicates that two nodes wrap the same relation.

  The `clone` methods creates a shallow copy of this node (the underlying
  relation remains unchanged).

  Finally, both `toSql` and `toString` return dialect specific SQL expression
  which appends an alias to relation's qualified name.

/*!## Implicit Convertions

`RelationNode` is implicitly converted to the `Relation` if necessary exposing
all the methods of the underlying relation. The alias is saved in a special
thread local stack so that it could become possible to refer to the alias
carried by this node, because otherwise it would be lost after conversion.

To understand this, consider following code:

    class User extends Record[...] {
      val id = "id".BIGINT
    }
    object User extends User[...] with Table[...] {...}

    val u = User AS "u"   // RelationNode of User with alias "u"
    SELECT(u.id).FROM(u)  // The `id` member does not exist in RelationNode,
                          // but it exists on the User, so the conversion works.
                          // But this eliminates the alias which will be refered
                          // by the projection. So it is saved into a stack and
                          // is recovered later.

/*!# Joins

Relations can be joined within one query to allow applying restrictions on
associated relations. The `JoinNode` class represents a join between two relations.
We stick to a general convention called _left associativity_: two joined nodes
with equal left nodes are considered equal:

    (ci JOIN co) == ci
    (ci JOIN co JOIN ca) == ((ci JOIN co) JOIN ca)

This way you can compose arbitrary complex query plans. The join condition
(the `ON` subclause) can be either inferred from associations or specified
manually using the `ON` method.
